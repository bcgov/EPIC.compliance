    "name" : "Inga Gas Plant Expansion",
    "description" : "ConocoPhillips Canada is proposing to expand the Inga Gas Plant, an existing natural gas processing plant southeast of Wonowon, B.C. and northwest from the city of Fort St. John, B.C. The proposed expansion would increase the capacity of the Inga Gas Plant to receive and process natural gas, natural gas liquids and produced water. This proposed expansion of the Inga Gas Plant does not meet the thresholds to automatically require an environmental assessment; however, because the Inga Gas Plant produces more than 125,000 tonnes of greenhouse gasses per year, the proponent is required to notify the Environmental Assessment Office of any modifications, to determine if an environmental assessment is necessary.",
